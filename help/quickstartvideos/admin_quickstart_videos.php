<p>
As an Organization or a Group Admin, you are in charge of adding new members to your group.
After talking to a prospective new member about the Coaching Companion, inform them that you will be creating a User Account for them. They will receive an automatic email with registration instructions when the account has been created.</p>
To create a new User Account:<br>
<ul>
	<li>	When logged into the coaching companion, navigate to CCAdmin.</li>
	<li>From the CCAdmin page, navigate to Manage Users.</li>
	<li>On the Manage Users page, open the Create a New User bar.</li>
	<li>Fill in the required information, paying attention to the Organization, Group and Role you are assigning.</li>
	<li>Be sure that the email address you use for the new User is the same email address that they will use to register with the ECLKC.</li>
	<li>Click "Create User"</li>
	<li>The new user will receive an automatic email welcoming them to the Coaching Companion. In the email are instructions for registering with the ECLKC so they can log in. They must register using the same email that you used when creating the new user account, so that when they log in, they will already be in the correct Organization and Group.</li>
	<li>Even before the new user registers with the ECLKC, you can begin to include them in Cycles.</li>
	<li>If a person registers with the ECLKC and visits the Coaching Companion site before a User Account has been created for them, they will be put in the New Users organization. If this happens, you will receive a red error notification when trying to use their email to create a New User. In this case, do the following:</li>
	<OL type="a">
	<li>Navigate to Manage Users.</li>
	<li>Open the Search for Users bar.</li>
	<li>Enter the email of the user you want to add and click Search.</li>
	<li>If that user is already in the system and is in the New Users organization, they will appear at the bottom of the page.</li>
	<li>Click on Edit in the table row of that user's email.</li>
	<li>Edit the Organization and Group of that user and click Update.  The user is now in your organization.</li>
    </OL>
</ul>
</p>

<div id="quickstart-2" class="faq-title">Add New Groups to Your Organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/253918565?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&byline=0&portrait=0&owner=0" >Watch Video</a></div>
<p>
As an Organization Admin, you are in charge of adding new Groups to your Organization.<br>
By creating a Group, placing one of the users in your Organization in the Group and making them a Group Admin, that user can invite their own new Coaches and Coachees, and then include these new users in Cycles.<br>
If a Coach is working alone and inviting people to become new Coachees, they should become Group Admin of their own Group.<br>
If a Coach is managing other Coaches and Coachees, they should become Group Admin of their own Group.<br>
You can appoint multiple people within a Group to be co-Admins of that group.
</p>
To Add New Groups to Your Organization:<br>
<ul>
	<li>When logged into the coaching companion, navigate to CCAdmin.</li>
	<li>From the CCAdmin page, navigate to Manage Organizations.</li>
	<li>On the Manage Organizations page, open the Create a New Group bar.</li>
	<li>Enter a descriptive name for your new Group.</li>
	<li>Click "Add"</li>
	<li>The page will reload and you will see your new Group in the list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As an Organization Admin, you are in charge putting users in your Organization into Groups.<br>
If your Organization does not require multiple groups, everyone in the Organization can stay in the Default Group.<br>
If you are managing many users, you can organize them into various Groups. The users in one group can only interact with other members of that same Group.<br>
</p>
To Change a User&apos;s Group:<br>
<ul>
	<li>When logged into the coaching companion, navigate to CCAdmin.</li>
	<li>From the CCAdmin page, navigate to Manage Users.</li>
	<li>On the Manage Users page, locate the user you want to update. Alternately, click on the Search for Users bar and enter the user&apos;s name or email.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Edit&quot; in the same row as the user&apos;s name</li>
	<li>The Update User page will load. Locate the &quot;Group&quot; field.</li>
	<li>Select the Group you to which you would like to assign this user.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Update User&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a Coach, Group Admin or Organization Admin who has created a new Cycle and an Action Plan Step, you will want to create a Focused Observation to offer feedback about an Action Plan Step.<br>
An Action Plan Step contains instructions for a Coachee, and a Focused Observation defines the scope of feedback that the Coach or a group of Observers will offer. There may be more than one specific scopes of feedback, each defined in their own Focused Observation.<br>
When a Focused Observation is created, an accompanying Reflection and Feedback is created automatically, which is where real discussion takes place.

These are available to peruse, and can be associated to various steps within a Cycle. Specifically, a Coach may want to include an example video in an Action Plan Step so that a Coachee will have a clear idea what sort of video they should produce themselves.

Some coaches in the OHS Coaching Companion will be invited to work with more than one organization. This is an agreement between the Organization Admin and the prospective coach. <br>
The way this would normally happen is that a personal communication between the Organization Admin and the Coach would happen, then the Coach requests to become part of the new organization, following the steps below. <br>
To become a Multi-Organizational Coach:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Begin by communicating with the Organization Admin about coaching in their organization.</li>
	<li>Once you have agreed to coach in the new organization, log in to the OHS Coaching Companion and navigate to &quot;My Account&quot; page.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the My Account page, click on the &quot;Request Access&quot; button.</li>
	<li>Select the organization you have been invited to coach in.</li>
	<li>Write a short note to the Organization Admin which will be sent with your request.</li>
	<li>Click on &quot;Send Request&quot;.</li>
	<li>The Organization Admins of the organization you chose will receive and email with your request.</li>
	<li>In the email is a link which will bring them to the Request Access page, with a form to accept the coach&apos;s request.</li>
	<li>When the Organization Admin accepts the coach&apos;s request, the coach will receive an email to that effect.</li>
	<li>After their request has been granted, the coach will see a list of the organizations they belong to in their My Account page.</li>
	<li>A coach can only work in one organization at a time, so they will switch between organizations by selecting the one they wish to work with and clicking &quot;Update&quot; in their My Account page.</li>
</ul>
