        Coaching Companion - FAQ
      </div>
    </p>


    <div id="faq-1" class="faq-title">Will my existing videos still be there?</div>
    <p>
      Yes. All videos which are part of your current Coaching Companion account will be available to use in the new
      version.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-2" class="faq-title">Will my password change with the new version of Coaching Companion?</div>
    <p>
      Passwords are encrypted for privacy and cannot be migrated. You will log into the new Coaching Companion with your
      Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center &#40;ECLKC&#41; account user email and password.</p>
    <div id="faq-3" class="faq-title">Can I use Coaching Companion on my mobile phone or tablet?</div>
    <p>
      Yes. The new version is designed to be viewed on mobile devices
    </p>
    <div id="faq-4" class="faq-title">Will the same groups be migrated together?</div>
    <p>
      Yes. Organizations have been migrated along with their sub-groups, and all users have been placed in their
      respective organizations and groups.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-5" class="faq-title">How do I add users?</div>
    <p>
      All users need to have an ECLKC account. The organization administrator can add users and groups, and place users
      into groups. The organization administrators can also assign group administrators who can put users into their
      groups.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-6" class="faq-title">How do I remove users?</div>
    <p>
      Only the organization and group administrators can add and remove users.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-7" class="faq-title">Is the Coaching Companion available in Spanish?</div>
    <p>
      There is not currently a Spanish version of the Coaching Companion
    </p>
    <div id="faq-8" class="faq-title">Is there a space allocation per account user? If so, what is the maximum capacity?
    </div>
    <p>
      There is no limit per account user.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-9" class="faq-title">Can any file type be stored, or are there specific file types allowable for
      storage? If so, what file types?</div>
    <p>
      Microsoft Word and Excel documents, PDF&#39;s, and images can be uploaded and
      stored. The most common video file types are permitted. To ensure that the video will perform as
      expected, <a href="https://vimeo.com/help/compression" target="_blank">Vimeo online best practices</a>.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-10" class="faq-title">Are the files being stored secure and only viewable by our "organization" or can
      anyone view those files?</div>
    <p>
      Any resources that are uploaded within a coaching cycle are secure and private and can only be viewed by the
      organization administrator and people you selected to be part of that coaching cycle.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-11" class="faq-title">How long can resources (e.g., video, images, audio, etc.) be stored?</div>
    <p>
      There are currently no restrictions on how long resources can be stored.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-12" class="faq-title">How do I delete resources I uploaded?</div>
    <p>
      Resources can be added and deleted individually from the cycles to which they belong by the user who uploaded
      them.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-13" class="faq-title">Can I generate reports through Coaching Companion?</div>
    <p>
      Reporting functionality is currently not included, but may be available at a later date.
    </p>
    <div id="faq-14" class="faq-title">Will there be resources specific to home visiting (e.g., needs assessments,
      videos, etc.)?</div>
    <p>
      Not currently, although many video exemplars may be used as resources by home visitors.
